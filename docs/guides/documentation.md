# Maintaining documentation

Use the [documentation map](../README.md) to find the document that owns a
topic before creating another one. Update that owner with the behavior change.

## Choose a location

| Material | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product introduction | Root README | Product purpose and first steps |
| End-user task | `docs/user/` | Prerequisites and steps to complete a task |
| Contributor or operator task | `docs/guides/` | Setup, implementation, operation, and verification |
| Contract details | `docs/reference/` | Inputs, outputs, defaults, and errors |
| Module ownership | `docs/architecture/` | Interfaces, composition, and source routing |
| Proposal or decision | `docs/design/` or `docs/adr/` | Alternatives, rationale, and decision status |
| Execution plan | `docs/plans/` | Implementation sequence for an issue |
| Runnable example | `examples/` | Buildable extension with explicit prerequisites |

Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names for new prose files. Keep established
entry-point names such as `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CONTEXT.md`, and the
numbered ADR convention. Prefer topic names over `new`, `final`, or bare issue
numbers. Link new guides from the documentation map or their owning guide.

## Make authority explicit

Link important claims to their owning code, schema, or generated reference.
Proposals and historical records should declare their status near the top and
name the current owner or successor. Query GitHub for live issue, release, and
delivery state instead of copying status tables into operating guides.

Keep generated blocks under their existing generator. For example,
`npm run docs:index` generates the design and plan indexes. Edit generator
inputs, regenerate, and review the output.

All tracked repository content is public, including documents omitted from
Pages. Use generic hostnames and paths. Keep private research, credentials,
customer data, and machine-specific operational logs outside the repository.
See [Contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for disclosure guidance.

## Document reusable integrations as they ship

For deployment, storage adapters, authentication, execution, and integration
changes, document the external company or project journey in the same PR. Use
[Integrating Station](integrating-station.md) for the delivery expectations:
prerequisites, runnable example or template, public contract, operating lifecycle,
and evidence. Keep generic domains and paths, state provider-specific dependencies,
and record unverified steps. Distinguish the self-operated path from managed
service conveniences without promising undelivered features or service levels.
The PR documentation-impact entry should link the affected guide/example or
explain concretely why that change does not affect the integration journey.

## Retire or move a document

1. Search incoming links and tooling references with `rg` before moving or
   deleting a file. Paths can be contracts for scripts as well as readers.
2. Keep historical rationale when it remains useful, with a status banner and
   successor link. Do not rewrite a dated assessment to imply current evidence.
3. Remove duplicate instructions in favor of the canonical guide. Preserve a
   forwarding page for a published path when practical.
4. Update navigation and generated indexes in the same change. Stage new files
   before checking: several checks use `git ls-files`.

## Verify the change

Start with `npm run gate:for -- <changed-paths...>` and the
[testing guide](testing.md). Existing documentation checks are:

```bash
npm run docs:truth:gate
npm run docs:reference:gate
npm run docs:pages:build
```

These check links, indexes, public content policy, examples, source paths,
documentation tests, and generated Pages output. They do not prove every prose
claim or deployment. Inspect changed instructions against source and report
runtime steps not exercised. New Pages content must be explicitly admitted in
`docs/pages/public-docs.json`; creating a guide does not publish it there.
